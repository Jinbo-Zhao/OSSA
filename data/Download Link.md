To collect enough data, we've executed the simulation model 50,000 times on each of the 1001 systems. Due to the data's significant size, we cannot provide it directly on GitHub. Therefore, we have stored the data on OneDrive and provided a download link.

You can download the data using the following link:

Once downloaded, please unzip the files into the current directory. This allows other scripts to access the data files correctly.
